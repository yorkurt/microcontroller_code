The Arduino code repository for YURT 2018-19.  Maintained primarily by Adam Silverman (@ajs0429) and Mastafa Awal (@awalm).  This repository stores various Arduino code projects and sketches, such as the code for motor drivers and gyroscopes.  Only the maintainers and admins can commit to master. For everyone else, start a branch and submit a pull request when you're done. We will review your code before it shows up in master.
